        <p>I have spent the last 3 years traveling the country for a mapping startup called Live XYZ. Within three months of being hired as a contractor, I mapped the entire city of Miami by myself and was then promoted to a full-time salaried position. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>After moving to Headquarters in New York City, I helped interview, hire, train and manage 15 employees using a 30-day training program that I developed from scratch. I created various initiatives and experiments on my own time to test new operational methods and to discover ways to improve my teams efficiency, accuracy, and overall performance. 
        </p>

        <p>My passion is to help grow an aggressive Startup's operations nationwide.
